# PokemonAPI
## Overview
The PokemonAPI repository is my web application built with TypeScript and React, with a strong focus on creating a fun Pokemon battle game. Throughout the development process, I aimed to practice and strengthen my skills in frontend development, API consumption, and application deployment. This repository includes all the necessary code, assets, and configuration files to run and maintain the application.

## Features
1. Pokemon Battle Game: I've developed an interactive game where users can select their Pokemon and engage in exciting battles with opponents. The battle mechanics involve calculating damage based on Pokemon stats and types, creating a challenging and immersive gameplay experience.
2. API Consumption: To power the game with Pokemon data, I've integrated the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/). By utilizing the RESTful API endpoints, I fetch and display dynamic information about Pokemon, moves, types, and more.
3. Component-based Architecture: The frontend of the application is structured using React components. This approach promotes modularity and reusability, as each component focuses on a specific functionality, such as displaying Pokemon details, handling battles, or rendering UI elements.
4. Responsive Design: I've ensured that the application is responsive and compatible with various screen sizes. By employing responsive design techniques, I've aimed to provide an optimal user experience across different devices.
5. Routing: To enable seamless navigation between different views within the application, I've utilized React Router. This client-side routing feature ensures smooth transitions and enhances the overall user experience.
6. Deployment: With the inclusion of configuration files and instructions, I've made it easy to deploy the application using Firebase Hosting. This allows the game to be accessible to users worldwide, promoting a global reach.

## Technologies Used
- TypeScript: I've leveraged the benefits of TypeScript throughout the project, enjoying its type safety and enhanced tooling capabilities.
- React: The frontend is developed using React, harnessing its component-based architecture and virtual DOM for efficient rendering.
- React Router: By utilizing React Router, I've achieved effective client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different views.
- CSS: Styling and customization are achieved through CSS, focusing on creating an immersive and visually appealing user interface.
- Firebase: I've chosen Firebase Hosting as the deployment solution, benefiting from its scalability and reliability as a hosting platform for the web app.

## Setup and Installation
To set up and run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/jquintanan/PokemonAPI.git`
2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Future Enhancements
Moving forward, I plan to continue expanding and improving the PokemonAPI project. Some potential future enhancements include:

- Adding additional game features, such as multiplayer battles, world exploration, and a leveling system for Pokemon, to further enhance the gameplay experience.
- Enhancing the user interface with more engaging visuals, animations, and sound effects to create a captivating atmosphere.
- Implementing additional API integrations, such as retrieving Pokemon images or detailed move information, to provide a comprehensive Pokemon experience.
- Incorporating user authentication and persistence to allow players to save and track their progress.
